        <p>
            Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous apes that inhabit the forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa.
             The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorillas and the western gorillas (both critically endangered),
            and either four or five subspecies. They are the largest living primates. The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of
             humans, from 95 to 99% depending on what is included, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after
            the chimpanzees and bonobos.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forests in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although their range covers a small percentage
             of Sub-Saharan Africa, gorillas cover a wide range of elevations. The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests
              of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging in altitude from 2,200 to 4,300 metres (7,200 to 14,100 ft). Lowland gorillas live in dense forests and
               lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea level, with western lowland gorillas living in
             Central West African countries and eastern lowland gorillasliving in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near its border with Rwanda.
