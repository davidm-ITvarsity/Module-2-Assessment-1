            The giraffe (Giraffa) is a genus of African even-toed ungulate mammals, the tallest living terrestrial animals and the largest ruminants.
            Taxonomic classifications of one to eight extant giraffe species have been described, based upon research into the mitochondrial and nuclear
            DNA, as well as morphological measurements of Giraffa, but the International Union for Conservation of Nature currently
            recognises only one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, the type species, with nine subspecies. Seven other species are extinct, prehistoric species
            known from fossils.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The giraffe has intrigued various cultures, both ancient and modern, for its peculiar appearance, and has often been featured in paintings, books,
            and cartoons. It is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as Vulnerable to extinction, and has been extirpatedfrom many
            parts of its former range. Giraffes are still found in numerous national parks and game reserves but estimations
            as of 2016 indicate that there are approximately 97,500 members of Giraffa in the wild. More than 1,600 were kept in zoos in 2010.
