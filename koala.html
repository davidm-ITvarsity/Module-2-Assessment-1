        <h1>Koala</h1>
        <p>
            The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus, or, inaccurately, koala bear) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia.
             It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats, which
              comprise the family Vombatidae. The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting
               Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large
                head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The koala has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15
                 kg (9–33 lb). Pelage colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern
             populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south. These populations possibly are separate subspecies, but this is disputed.</p>

            Koalas were hunted by Indigenous Australians and depicted in myths and cave art for millennia. The first
             recorded encounter between a European and a koala was in 1798, and an image of the animal was published 
             in 1810 by naturalist George Perry. Botanist Robert Brownwrote the first detailed scientific description
              of the koala in 1814, although his work remained unpublished for 180 years. Popular artist John Gould
               illustrated and described the koala, introducing the species to the general British public. Further
                details about the animal's biology were revealed in the 19th century by several English scientists.
                 Because of its distinctive appearance, the koala is recognised worldwide as a symbol of Australia.
                  Koalas are listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.[1] The Australian
                   government similarly lists specific populations in Queensland and New South Wales as Vulnerable.[5]
                    The animal was hunted heavily in the early 20th century for its fur, and large-scale cullings in
                     Queensland resulted in a public outcry that initiated a movement to protect the species. Sanctuaries
                      were established, and translocation efforts moved to new regions
             koalas whose habitat had become fragmented or reduced. The biggest threat to their existence
              is habitat destruction caused by agriculture and urbanisation.

        <h2>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</h2>
        <p>
            You will find the koalas at pen E26, right opposite the giraffes.
