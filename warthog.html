            Phacochoerus is a genus in the family Suidae, commonly known as warthogs. It is the sole genus of subfamily Phacochoerinae.
             They are found in open and semiopen habitats, even in quite arid regions, in sub-Saharan Africa. The two species were formerly
              considered conspecific under the scientific name Phacochoerus aethiopicus,
             but today this is limited to the desert warthog, while the best-known and most widespread species, the common warthog (or simply warthog) is Phacochoerus africanus.</p>

        <p>
            Although covered in bristly hairs, their bodies and heads appear largely naked from a distance, with only the
             crest along the back, and the tufts on their cheeks and tails being obviously haired. The English name refers 
             to their facial wattles, which are particularly distinct in males. They also have very distinct tusks, which 
             reach a length of 25.5 to 63.5 cm (10.0 to 25.0 in) in the males, but are always smaller in the females. They 
             are largely herbivorous, but occasionally also eat small animal food. While both species remain fairly common
              and widespread, and therefore are considered
             to be of Least Concern by the IUCN, the nominate subspecies of the desert warthog, commonly known as the Cape warthog, became extinct around 1865.

        <h2>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</h2>
        <p>
            You will find the warthogs at pen E30, right next to the elephants.
